                <h2></h2>
                <p>Characterized by its highly ornamented Mayan-inspired exterior, the Mexico City Mexico Temple is an
                    acclaimed landmark in northeastern Mexico City, located near Bosque de Arag√≥n‚Äîone of the city's
                    principal parks. The temple grounds are park-like themselves, featuring beautiful gardens and an
                    enchanting water feature. Several other Church buildings share the "Manzana del Templo" (Temple
                    Square) including a missionary training center, stake center, patron housing facility, and an
                    informative visitors' center‚Äîfree to the public. The visitors' center's centerpiece is a supernal
                    reproduction of Thorvaldsen's Christus statue. During Christmas, the grounds are decorated with
                    hundreds of thousands of lights in a festive display of the season.?</p>

                <h2>More Incredible Facts</h2>
                <p>The Mexico City Mexico Temple was the first temple built in Mexico.

                    The Mexico City Mexico Temple was the second temple built in a Spanish-speaking country, following
                    the Santiago Chile Temple (1983).

                    The Mexico City Mexico Temple is the largest temple outside of the United States.

                    The Mexico City Mexico Temple is one of five temples featuring an angel Moroni statue holding the
                    gold plates. (The other four temples are the Los Angeles California Temple, Washington D.C. Temple,
                    Jordan River Utah Temple, and Seattle Washington Temple.)

                    Even since endowments were first given in Spanish in 1945 in the Mesa Arizona Temple, faithful
                    Mexican Saints looked forward with anticipation to the time when they might be blessed with a temple
                    in their own country.

                    When Church architect Emil B. Fetzer received the assignment to design the Mexico City Mexico
                    Temple, he turned to a book on Mayan architecture, which Heber Grant Taylor and his wife felt
                    inspired to give him 18 years earlier from the library of his grandfather President Heber J. Grant.

                    An incredible 9,000 attended the one-hour groundbreaking ceremony of the Mexico City Mexico Temple.
                    Elder Boyd K. Packer offered the prayer dedicating the site in Spanish.

                    During its 10-day open house, more than 110,000 visitors toured the Mexico City Mexico Temple
                    including thousands of government, business, and civic leaders. Mission presidents estimated 2,900
                    requested visits as a direct result of the open house.

                    At the dedication of the Mexico City Mexico Temple, Elder Ezra Taft Benson received the distinct
                    impression that God was not pleased with Church members' neglect of the Book of Mormon. Stressing
                    the importance of the Book of Mormon would later become one of the hallmarks of his presidency.

                    Following its completion, the Mexico City Mexico Temple received an international award for artistic
                    use of precast concrete.

                    The Mexico City Mexico Temple has received favorable attention from the school of architecture at
                    the University of Mexico, becoming the subject of much study.

                    In March 2007, the Mexico City Mexico Temple was closed for a year-and-a-half renovation and
                    remodeling project, which included seismic enhancements, replacement of the precast concrete
                    exterior panels, refurbishment of the angel Moroni statue, revamping of the landscaping, and
                    remodeling of the baptistry, main lobby, corridors, sealing rooms, and ordinance rooms.

                    By its 25th anniversary, the Mexico City Mexico Temple had dropped at least eight feet in elevation
                    due to the rapid subsidence of Mexico's capital city.

                    In January 2014, the Mexico City Mexico Temple closed for an 18-month renovation of the interior.
                    Over 96,000 people toured the temple during its public open. The evening prior to the rededication,
                    the youth of the temple district presented a cultural celebration entitled A Legacy of Faith and
                    Sacrifice. President Henry B. Eyring, first counselor in the First Presidency, rededicated the
                    temple.</p>
